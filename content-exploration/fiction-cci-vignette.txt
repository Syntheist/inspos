CCI world building vignette #10 - enter Shellman (zine edit)

_...RIGHT Director disappears..._

Théa woke abruptly in the deep violet light of the early dawn, her dreams fragmenting and dissipating into the clear morning air.

She was enjoying being out in the fresh early morning and was crossing the hive’s outer gates when she was enveloped in a twinkling azure haze. In just a few seconds, the halo of light faded away, leaving everything on the hive gate as it was.

She found herself in a space of muted greens, blues and yellows. The whole reminded her of being inside a coral reef. The air was full of popping, crackling, whooping and grunting which resolved into her own language.

“Théa. Last child of the Hundred Moon family.”

“Who are you?”

“We are Shellman.”

“What do you want?”

“Lung Mother’s pod. Your kind is still trapped by short-sighted G$X profits,” they scoffed. “We know you think there are others, but they are the last. Stop the Wakoku ships.”

Théa woke, lying curled up on top of the hive gate, her head spinning. Shakily she stood and looked around. The sun was setting. Gathering her wits, she slowly made her way to RIGHT HQ.
